It's a social media platform that lets you post anything that gets stored on the blockchain. And according to your interest, you can join a call powered by Huddle01 - a decentralized Video Calling app. To make it more clear - For example: Suppose I post about an ongoing football Match: "Hey interesting match, Come over". Now anyone interested in the match can join the video call simply by connecting their wallet. It's sort of like Omegle but lets you choose your interest. Now over a video call, you can discuss with random strangers.
